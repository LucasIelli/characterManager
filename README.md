### Hello and welcome ! First of all, this site has been made during our formation [BeCode](https://becode.org/fr/apprendre/developpeur-web-junior/) to train our skills on the `Javascript` language. And of course around `HTML` and `CSS`.

### <u>1. What's the project?</u>

More about the choosen topic, as you'll see, we like a lot `what we want`, so enjoy our passion about it !
The website contains some informations about `topic choosen`.
To make this site we got some challenges on `we'll see our issues`.

### <u>2. More about us :</u>

We are two in this team, the first one to present himself is :
[Laurent](https://github.com/LaurentBrajkovic) is a Belgian guy very enthousiast one and very great team mate, I'm really happy to work with him and we'll enjoy a lot work on this project :D `Type what you want about you Laurent ^^`

And the second is :
Hello ! My name is [Lucas](https://github.com/LucasIelli), I'm a 28 years old junior web developper. I had some trouble to find my "way" and here I am in a second life for coding and propose some beautiful web pages like this one. Coding it's not only a passion, that's a team too and a great team work. Of course I've got some hobbies and the most one is ... VIDEO GAMES ! Wait... What? Yeah, I still have enough time for it ;)
### <u>3. One more thing :</u>
Currently we are in a formation called [BeCode](https://becode.org/fr/apprendre/developpeur-web-junior/) in Belgium, Liège. We started it the 22nd June 2021, so maybe we have done some roads when you read this line. Don't hesitate to catch us if you have a feedback or anything else !

#### <u>The project [characterManager](need link on GitHub Pages)</u>

#### Hope you'll enjoy our work and see ya' in the world wide web !
