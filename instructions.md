1. Will be about Berserk manga.
2. We choose 8 characters for start :
- Griffith
- Guts
- Casca
- Judeau
- Pippin
- Corkus
- Rickert
- Gaston
3. We need to view the char's card, edit it, and create/delete char.
4. Use [Charcter Database API](https://character-database.becode.xyz/)
5. Follow the template so download the 3 [files](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Hamilton-5.32/tree/master/01-main-course/02-the-hills/02-character-manager/design) and add it into your local storage.
6. Main menu will be a grid of all characters in the database with:
- Circle Image [link](https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/)
- Name
- Description
- Button 'See char'
- At the end a button to add a new character.
- Maybe on hover a card, appear a button delete the character with an alert 'Are you sure you want to delete this char?' <b>OR</b> a button delete in the single page, as we want.
7. Single character when you click the button 'See char' will be a link for a new HTML page/tab, only one for each char.
8. Single char need :
- Delete button? (and alert 'Are you sure?')
- button for Character Editor
- Description in markdown display like HTML

9. Char creation :
- When click button 'edit' display a character editor (form). In it we have to modify the font-size, bolder and other things. cfr(pdf of "template" view)
- Again, contain the name, short description, image [hint](https://web.dev/read-files/) and a longer despcription.
10. Char editor:
- Really the same as char Creation (9) just we can modify the existing char.
11. Research bar :
- OPTIONAL !
12. WebSite:
- Push it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Asking to use the best practices of JS [Instruction](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Hamilton-5.32/blob/master/01-main-course/02-the-hills/02-character-manager/jsbestpractises.md)
13. Tips :
- [API REST](https://github.com/leny/klopedi/blob/master/rest/rest.md)
- Create a .gitignore file with node_modules in it and everything we don't need to push. Like this file :)
14. Will we use framework?
- SASS, SCSS or only CSS as you want again.
15. HTTP request will be fetching not axios (cause not time)
16. Apparently we can test our API on [postman](https://www.postman.com/) [tuto youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juldrxDrSH0&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-oT0GenwPLcJAPD_SiFK3C)

MAYBE IMPORTANT [A postman collection](https://static.becode.xyz/character-database/characters-database.postman_collection.json)
17. Bonus : create a second project aside this one with an other esthetic.
